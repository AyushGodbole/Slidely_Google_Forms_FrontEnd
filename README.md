# Google Forms (FrontEnd)
As a project assigned by Slidely AI, a frontend version of Google Forms has been created using Visual Basic in Visual Studio. Visual Basic, a language developed by Microsoft, enables rapid application development with an intuitive graphical user interface. This project demonstrates the capability to design user-friendly forms and interfaces, combining programming skills with UI/UX design principles. Replicating Google Forms showcases proficiency in developing interactive and functional web-based applications.
